# Twitter_sentiment_analysis_with_NLP

I developed a Twitter Sentiment Analysis model utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets as positive or negative. This project was completed as part of my training at Pinnacle Labs.

Technical Details:

1. Data Acquisition: Utilized the Twitter API to collect a dataset of tweets for sentiment analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing: Implemented text preprocessing techniques, including removing special characters and stop words, and performing stemming using the Porter Stemmer to prepare the data for model training.

3. Feature Extraction: Employed TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert textual data into numerical vectors, enabling machine learning algorithms to process the data.

4. Model Development: Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiment of tweets into positive and negative categories.

5. Model Evaluation: Achieved an accuracy of 77.7% on the test dataset, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in sentiment classification.

6. Deployment: Saved the trained model using Pickle to enable future predictions on new tweets.

Skills Gained:

1. Proficient in Python: Leveraged Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise: Applied NLP techniques like stemming, stop word removal, and TF-IDF to prepare textual data for analysis.

3. Machine Learning (ML) proficiency: Developed and trained a Logistic Regression model to accurately classify tweets as positive or negative, achieving an accuracy of 77.7%.

This project demonstrates my ability to build robust sentiment analysis models that can be used to:

1. Monitor brand reputation: Analyze public sentiment towards a brand or product to gain insights into customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
2. Track customer feedback: Automatically categorize customer reviews or tweets to understand customer sentiment and improve products or services.
Identify emerging trends: Detect trending topics and public opinion towards those topics, providing valuable insights for businesses and decision-makers.
3. Conduct market research: Understand consumer sentiment towards various products or services to inform marketing strategies and campaigns.
